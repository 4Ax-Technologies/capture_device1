# rc1_run.py

The rc1_run.py program draws upon a diverse range of libraries. One of these is 4Aspyx, the 4Ax python plugin library.

4Aspyx is not currently open source and the code offered below draws upon a number of 4Aspyx scripts. These scripts are unique to a particular use case and are therefore
currently confidential. However the underlying architecture is clearly defined.
