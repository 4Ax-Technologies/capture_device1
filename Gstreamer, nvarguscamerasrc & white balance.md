# Gstreamer, nvarguscamerasrc & white balance

The __Gstreamer__ manual is at: https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/  
Many diverse use cases are described in the Nvidia Gstreamer documentation and a good deal of patience is required to identify that the
__nvarguscamerasrc__ plugin is the most appropriate plugin to use in a capture device pipeline such as this.
The simplest way to glean information regarding best practice for deploying nvarguscamerasrc pipelines is to work on the Nvidia processor itself 
where, it turns out, Gstreamer stores all it's multimedia plugins at the path shown at the end of this page.  
Use the command "$ gst-inspect-1.0 nvarguscamerasrc‚Äù to access factory details on the machine. 

A particularly significant capabability that is described in Pad Templates in the factory details is:

### wbmode         : White balance affects the color temperature of the photo

                        flags: readable, writable
                        
                        Enum "GstNvArgusCamWBMode" Default: 1, "auto"

(0): off              - GST_NVCAM_WB_MODE_OFF

(1): auto             - GST_NVCAM_WB_MODE_AUTO

(2): incandescent     - GST_NVCAM_WB_MODE_INCANDESCENT          (__2000k__)

(3): fluorescent      - GST_NVCAM_WB_MODE_FLUORESCENT          (__3000k__)

(4): warm-fluorescent - GST_NVCAM_WB_MODE_WARM_FLUORESCENT      (__2700k__)

(5): daylight         - GST_NVCAM_WB_MODE_DAYLIGHT		          (__6000k__)

(6): cloudy-daylight  - GST_NVCAM_WB_MODE_CLOUDY_DAYLIGHT	      (__6500k__)

(7): twilight         - GST_NVCAM_WB_MODE_TWILIGHT		          (__8000k__)

(8): shade            - GST_NVCAM_WB_MODE_SHADE		              (__10000k__)

(9): manual           - GST_NVCAM_WB_MODE_MANUAL

*  The (__kelvin colour temperature figures__) have been added to the factory details by 4Ax

*  Some of the colour temperature figures vary somewhat depending on the reference source

*  It is noteworthy that a neutral __4000k__ setting is not provided (if you are looking for this perhaps try "(0): off" before using "(9): manual")

*  The choice of mode setting will depend on the individual use case: location, hardware and training data

### watch outs:

*  In the default "(1): auto" mode consider whether damage could potentially affect the white balance and thus cause a mismatch with training data: e.g crack damage to
the wall of an enclosed space could result in daylight entering the inspection area
   
*  "(9): manual" might look like an attractive option but it's default setting is unuseable: Gstreamer uses R:G:G:B values (Bayer-based) to set colour temperature 
and the default values are: "r:%0.3f gO:%0.3f gE:%0.3f b:%0.3f\n", which will cause under-exposed images with a strong green bias in most use cases. To work with this mode
it is necessary to adjust the values by trial and error and then re-compile the C++ file. "r:%1.0f gO:%0.5f gE:%0.5f b:%1.0f\n" would be a better starting point, but some
of these values will almost certainly need to be further adjusted.

*  When searching for examples of nvarguscamerasrc usage, search engines and LLMs often turn up examples from the depracated predecessor, nvcamerasrc. 'Argus' is a reference
from Greek legend to a many-eyed (i.e multi-camera stream) god. Some helpful insights on how to get optimal results using nvarguscamera can be found at [this site](https://toptechboy.com/jetson-xavier-nx-lesson-4-understanding-and-using-gstreamer-for-absolute-beginners/) . 

*  Access __gstreamer__ samples such as userAutoWhiteBalance on the Jetson Nano at:   
/usr/src/jetson_multimedia/api/argus/samples. The R:G:G:B values referred to above are found in /userAutoWhiteBalance/main.cpp .

*  __Note deepstream__ samples for setting the streaming pipeline are at:
